Types of Data That Can Be Used to Create a Pandas Series
A pandas Series is a one-dimensional labeled array that can store various types of data. The following types of data can be used while creating a Series object in pandas:

1. List
A Python list can be directly converted into a Series.

import pandas as pd  
s = pd.Series([10, 20, 30, 40])  
print(s)  

2. Tuple
Tuples can also be used to create a Series in pandas.

s = pd.Series((5, 10, 15, 20))  
print(s)  

3. Dictionary
When using a dictionary, the keys become the index of the Series, and the values are stored as elements.

data = {'a': 100, 'b': 200, 'c': 300}  
s = pd.Series(data)  
print(s)  

4. NumPy Array
A NumPy array can be converted into a Series, allowing efficient handling of numerical data.

import numpy as np  
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  
s = pd.Series(arr)  
print(s)  

5. Scalar Value
A single value can be assigned to all elements of a Series when an index is provided.

s = pd.Series(7, index=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4])  
print(s)
